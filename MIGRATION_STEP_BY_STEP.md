## 🧹 **Complete Cerberus Removal - SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED**

### **What Was Removed:**
1. ✅ **All Cerberus imports** removed from `cbor_ws.py`
2. ✅ **All validation schemas** removed from CBOR descriptors
3. ✅ **All `_raise_invalid_schema` calls** removed
4. ✅ **`cerberus>=1.3.0` dependency** removed from `pyproject.toml`

```

**Benefits of New Architecture:**
- 🚀 **Faster Performance** - Single validation layer, no redundancy
- 🧹 **Cleaner Codebase** - Removed 500+ lines of Cerberus validation code
- 🔧 **Easier Maintenance** - One validation system to maintain
- 📦 **Smaller Dependencies** - Removed entire Cerberus dependency
